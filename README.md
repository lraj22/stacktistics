# Stacktistics

View your stats for any Stack Exchange site. Features in-depth rep history, badge tracker, best posts, and general flags/votes/more data.

You can preview the site at <https://stacktistics.glitch.me/>. It's currently not ready for use, but I made it public anyways Â¯\\\_\(ãƒ„\)\_/Â¯. Don't break anything, I'm watching you...

Yet to be posted to StackApps. Stay tuned! :)
