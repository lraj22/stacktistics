# Reporting a Vulnerability

We take vulnerability reports seriously. To report a security vulnerability, please use GitHub's Security Advisory feature. [Click here](https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/new) to start a new report.

We will notify you as soon as possible when we receive your report. After the first reply, we may ask for more information in order to fix the issue. You will be kept up to date on the progress of a fix to the vulnerability. Your effort to responsibly disclose the security vulnerability is appreciated.
